File types
==========================

Most of the object types in Klamp't can be saved and loaded from disk in
a manner that is compatible with the RobotPose app, the I/O mechanisms,
and resource managment mechanisms. The following custom file types are
used in Klamp't:

-  World files (.xml)
-  Robot files (.rob)
-  Robot URDF files with Klamp't-specific elements (.urdf)
-  Geometric primitive files (.geom)
-  Rigid object files (.obj)
-  Configuration files (.config)
-  Configuration sequence files (.configs)
-  Linear path files (.path)
-  Multipath files (.xml)
-  Hold files (.hold)
-  Stance files (.stance)
-  Grasp files (.xml)

Klamp't also supports the following standard file types:

-  Triangle mesh files (.off, and with many other types with Assimp)
-  Point cloud data files (.pcd)

Primitive data file format
--------------------------

A Config (robot configuration) file is serialized to a
whitespace-delimited string in the format ``N q1 ... qN`` where N is the
number of DOF in the robot.

A Vector3 or Vector4 is serialized to a whitespace-delimited string in
the form ``x y z`` or ``x y z w`` respectively.

A Matrix3 or Matrix4 is serialized to a whitespace-delimited string in
row-major order, unless otherwise specified. I.e.,
``r11 r12 r13 r21 r22 r23 r31 r32 r33``

A RigidTransform is serialized to a whitespace-delimited string with the
rotation matrix in row-major order, followed by the translation. I.e.,
``r11 r12 r13 r21 r22 r23 r31 r32 r33 t1 t2 t3``

Geometry file formats
---------------------

Geometries can be loaded from a variety of file formats. The native
triangle mesh format is Object File Format (OFF), which is a simple
ASCII file format. Klamp't also natively supports OBJ file format. If
Klamp't is compiled with Assimp support, it can also load a variety of
other formats including STL, DAE, VMRL, etc. Point clouds can be loaded
from PCD files (v0.7), as specified by the Point Cloud Library (PCL).

Geometric primitives are stored in a string format (.geom). TODO:

Geometry groups are stored in a string format (.group). TODO: document
me

with #, may appear anywhere on a line, and comments continue until the
end of the line. Lines can be continued to the next line using the
backslash \\.

A robot has N links, and D drivers. Elements of each line are
whitespace-separated. Indices are zero-based. inf indicates infinity.
Some items are optional, indicated by default values.

URDF files (.urdf) with Klamp't-specific elements
-------------------------------------------------

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is a widely used XML-based robot
format found in ROS and other packages. Klamp't has always been able to
convert URDF files to .rob files, which can be edited to introduce
Klamp't-specific attributes, like motor simulation parameters and
ignoring certain self-collision pairs. Starting in version 0.6, Klamp't
can now read those attributes from URDF files with an extra ``<klampt>``
XML element. The schema for defining this element is as follows:

-  ``<robot>``: top level element. Follows URDF format as usual.

   *Children*

   -  ``<klampt>``: specifies Klamp't-specific parameters

      *Attributes*

      -  ``use_vis_geom`` (bool, optional, default false): use
         visualization geometry in imported model.
      -  ``flip_yz`` (bool, optional, default true): flip the Y-Z axes
         of imported link geometries.
      -  ``package_root`` (string, optional, default ".""): describe the
         path of the package described in any "package://" URI strings,
         relative to the URDF file.
      -  ``world_frame`` (string, optional, default "world"): the name
         of the fixed world frame.
      -  ``freeze_root_link`` (bool, optional, default false): if true,
         the root link is frozen in space (useful for debugging)
      -  ``default_mass`` (float, optional, default 1e-8): default mass
         assigned to links not given mass parameters.
      -  ``default_inertia`` (float, ``Vector3``, or ``Matrix3``,
         optional, default 1e-8): default inertia matrix assigned to
         links not given mass parameters.

      *Children*

      -  ``<link>``: describes link parameters.

         *Attributes*

         -  ``name`` (string): identifies the link.
         -  ``physical`` (bool, optional, default true): if set to 0,
            this is a virtual link with no mass.
         -  ``accMax`` (float, optional, default inf): sets the
            acceleration maximum for this link.
         -  ``servoP``, ``servoI``, ``servoD`` (float, optional,
            defaults 10, 0, 1): sets the PID gains of this joint (note:
            must be a normally driven link).
         -  ``dryFriction``, ``viscousFriction`` (float, optional,
            default 0): sets the friction constants for this joint.

      -  ``<noselfcollision>``: turns off self collisions.

         *Attributes*

         -  ``pairs`` (string, optional): identifies one or more pairs
            of links for which self-collision should be turned off.
            Whitespace-separated. Each item can be an index or a link
            name.
         -  ``group1``,\ ``group2`` (string, optional): if ``group1``
            and group2 are specified, collisions between all of the
            links in group 1 (a whitespace separated list of link
            indices or names) will be turned off. Either ``pairs`` or
            both ``group1`` and ``group2`` must be present in the
            element.

      -  ``<selfcollision>``: turns on certain self collisions. Note: if
         this item is present, default self collisions are not used.
         *Same attributes as ``<noselfcollisions>``.*

      -  ``<mount>``: mounts a geometry or another robot to a link.
          
         *Attributes*

         - ``link`` (string): the name or integer index of the link.
         - ``file`` (string): the absolute path / relative path / URL of a geometry file (OFF, OBJ, STL, etc) or other robot file (.urdf or .rob).
         - ``transform`` (12 floats, optional):  the relative transform of the sub-robot, given by a row-major list of the entries of the 3x3 rotation matrix followed by the translation (12 values in ``T``).
         - `prefix` or `as` (string, optional): an alternative identifier X for the sub-robot.  If provided, then "X:" is prepended to all of its link names. (`as` added in 0.8.6)

Piecewise Linear Path (.path) files
-----------------------------------

A piecewise linear path file has the following format:

::

    t1   N q11 q12 ... q1N
    t2   N q21 q22 ... q2N
    ...
    tM   N qM1 qM2 ... qMN

Where the path is given by M points in time corresponding to M
milestones, each of which is a ``Config`` of length N. Each row consists
of a time and a milestone. It is assumed that t[k+1] >= t[k] for all k,
and typically it is assumed that t1=0.
