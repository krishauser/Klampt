Building from source
=====================

Klamp't source code is available via the git repository at
`https://github.com/krishauser/Klampt/ <https://github.com/krishauser/Klampt/>`__.
The command

.. code:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/krishauser/Klampt

will download it to your machine.

The Klampt Python API is built on a large C++ code base.  To build
the Klampt C++ library and Python API, you will need to obtain
the following dependencies, which may already be installed on your
machine:

-  CMake (version >= 2.6)
-  GLPK, the GNU Linear Programming Kit
-  Python, if you wish to build the Python bindings.
-  (recommended) Assimp, if you wish to load STL, DAE and other geometry
   file formats. (Only OBJ and OFF are natively supported in Klampt.)
-  (recommended) Qt5, if you wish to use nicer GUIs for the core
   applications.
-  (optional) ROS, if you wish to write to/read from ROS topics.
-  (optional) OMPL, if you wish to use the OMPL motion planning
   bindings.
-  (optional) GLUT, if you wish to use the legacy GLUI programs.

Linux-like Environments
-----------------------

The `Installation Tutorial <https://github.com/krishauser/Klampt/blob/master/Cpp/docs/Tutorials/Install-Linux.md>`_
has step by step instructions, but if you get stuck, perhaps the below
instructions may help.

**Building dependencies.** First, the dependencies must be downloaded
and built. On Ubuntu systems, try:

.. code:: sh

   sudo apt-get install cmake libglpk-dev libassimp-dev qt5-default libpython-dev

Then, change into the Klampt/Cpp/Dependencies folder and unpack KrisLibrary, TinyXML,
and ODE using the command 'make unpack-deps'. After configuring the
dependencies as described below, they can be built using the command
'make deps'.

To configure the dependencies, consider the following notes:

-  KrisLibrary may need to be configured for your particular system. Try
   running ``cmake-gui`` and changing the Advanced variables.
-  By default, we compile ODE in double floating-point precision. The
   reason for this is that on some Linux systems, ODE becomes unstable
   in single floating-point precision and may crash with assertion
   failures. This may be changed on other systems, if you wish, by
   toggling ODEDOUBLE=0 or 1 in Klampt/Cpp/Dependencies/Makefile. *Note:
   if you have already built ODE and then later change its precision,
   you must do a clean build of ODE as well as the CMake cache.*

**Enabling Assimp support (optional).** To load a larger variety of 3D
meshes, Klamp't can be configured to use the Asset Importer (
`Assimp <http://assimp.sourceforge.net/>`__) library. Once Assimp
4.0.x is installed on your system, KrisLibrary and Klampt should
automatically detect it when ``cmake`` is run.

**Run CMake to build Klamp't Makefiles.** Run "cmake ." to build the
Klamp't makefiles.

**Building static library and apps.** The static library is built using
'make Klampt'. The main apps to build are RobotTest, SimTest, and
RobotPose. Typing 'make [target]' will build the target.

**Building Python bindings.** Once the Klamp't static library is built,
the Python bindings in Klampt/Python/klampt can be built and installed into
your current Python environment using ``make
python``.  Or, to use another version of Python, you can change directory into
Klampt/Python and use ``python3.x -m pip install .`` where ``python3.x`` is the
specific Python executable that you want to use.

IMPORTANT: You must set up Python to be able to find the shared library
files for external dependencies. Otherwise, you will get errors
importing the \_robotsim module when calling import klampt. To do this,
you may either:

#. Set the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable to include the
   locations of the TinyXML, ODE, and (optionally) Assimp shared
   libraries. These will be .so (or DLL) files.
#. OR move the shared library files into your shared library path
#. OR on Linux-like systems, edit /etc/ld.so.conf as appropriate and
   then run ldconfig (as sudo).

**Building documentation.** To build the Klamp't C++ API documentation
using Doxygen, type ``make docs`` in Klampt/. ``make python-docs`` will
build the Python API documentation.

Windows
-------

Prebuilt binary executables and static libraries for VS2015 are
available on the `Klamp't website <http://klampt.org>`__.

Installing C++ applications from binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From `http://klampt.org <http://klampt.org/>`__, download and run the
Win32 Klamp't installer.

To build your own C++ applications that link to Klamp't
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Clone the Klampt Git repository from
   https://github.com/krishauser/Klampt
#. Run the Win32 Klamp't installer or obtain the x64 binary package.
   Copy the include and lib directories to ``Klampt/``
#. Clone the KrisLibrary Git repository from
   https://github.com/krishauser/KrisLibrary to the
   ``Klampt/Cpp/Dependencies`` folder as the target location.
#. From `http://klampt.org <http://klampt.org/>`__, download the
   appropriate Win32 Klamp't dependencies for your Visual Studio version
   (both Release and Debug are recommended). Unpack into
   Klampt/Cpp/Dependencies.
#. In your own CMake project, set ``KLAMPT_ROOT`` to the appropriate
   path and put the following lines into your CMakeLists.txt (along with
   whatever other lines are needed to build your project)

   .. code:: cmake

       SET (CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${KLAMPT_ROOT}/CMakeModules")
       FIND_PACKAGE(Klampt REQUIRED)
       ADD_DEFINITIONS(${KLAMPT_DEFINITIONS})
       INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${KLAMPT_INCLUDE_DIRS})
       TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(MyApp ${KLAMPT_LIBRARIES})

#. Build your project in standard CMake fashion.

Building Klamp't from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After following Steps 1, 3, and 4 in the instructions above, running the
standard CMake procedure in ``Klampt/`` (using ``Klampt/msvc`` as the
build location for 32-bit windows, or Klampt/msvc64 as the build
location for 64-bit windows) should generate appropriate Visual Studio
project files.

Building Python bindings from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After running CMake as above, copy the file
``Klampt/msvc/Python/setup.py`` (or ``Klampt/msvc64/Python/setup.py``)
to the ``Klampt/Python`` directory. Finally, open a Visual Studio
Command Prompt in *Administrative Mode*, and depending on your VS
version, run:


VS 2012:

.. code:: sh

    set VS90COMNTOOLS=%VS110COMNTOOLS%
    python setup.py install

VS 2015:

.. code:: sh

    set VS90COMNTOOLS=%VS140COMNTOOLS%
    python setup.py install

Building dependencies from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to build dependencies from scratch, Visual Studio project
files are available. Make sure to place all compiled library (.lib)
files in the Klampt/Cpp/Dependencies folder. All libraries should be
built in Win32 mode, with C++ code generation set to Multithreaded DLL /
Multithreaded Debug DLL.

The general procedure is as follows:

#. Acquire GLEW and optionally (but recommended) WinGLPK 4.61 and/or
   Assimp 4.0.x. Place the glew32.lib, glpk\_4\_61.lib files in
   Klampt/Cpp/Dependencies or in your Visual Studio path. Place the
   Assimp folder in Klampt/Cpp/Dependencies.
#. Configure and edit dependencies as follows:

   #. ODE: Set up build files with ``premake4 vs2012`` or ``premake4 vs2015``.

#. Compile all dependencies except for KrisLibrary. Place all generated
   .lib files into the Klampt/Cpp/Dependencies directory.

   #. ODE: compile in double precision, Static.
   #. TinyXML: compile with STL support.

#. Compile KrisLibrary last. CMake files are available for compiling
   KrisLibrary with/without Assimp support and with/without GLPK
   support.
#. After compiling, all of the .dll files associated with dependency
   libraries should be placed in the appropriate Klamp't binary folders.
