/** @brief Geometry appearance information.  Supports vertex/edge/face
 * rendering, per-vertex color, and basic color texture mapping.  Uses
 * OpenGL display lists, so repeated calls are fast.
 *
 * For more complex appearances, you will need to call your own OpenGL calls.
 *
 * Appearances can be either references to appearances of objects in the world,
 * or they can be standalone. 
 *
 * Performance note: Avoid rebuilding buffers (e.g., via :meth:`refresh`)  as 
 * much as possible.
