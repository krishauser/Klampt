 *
 * Attributes:
 *
 *     vertices (SWIG vector of floats):  a list of vertices, given as
 *         a flattened coordinate list [x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, ...]
 *     indices (SWIG vector of ints): a list of triangle vertices given
 *         as indices into the vertices list, i.e., [a1,b1,c2, a2,b2,c2, ...]
 *
 * Note: because the bindings are generated by SWIG, you can access
 * the indices / vertices members via some automatically generated
 * accessors / modifiers.  In particular len(), append(), and
 * indexing via [] are useful. Some other methods like resize() are
 * also provided.  However, you CANNOT set these items via assignment. 
 *
 * Examples::
 *
 *     m = TriangleMesh()
 *     m.vertices.append(0)
 *     m.vertices.append(0)
 *     m.vertices.append(0)
 *     print(len(m.vertices))  #prints 3
 *     m.vertices = [0,0,0]   #this is an error
 *     m.vertices += [1,2,3]   #this is also an error
 *
 * To get all vertices as a numpy array::
 * 
 *     verts = m.getVertices()
 *
 * To get all indices as a numpy array::
 * 
 *     inds = m.getIndices()

 *        name of each property is given by the ``propertyNames`` member.
 *     propertyNames (SWIG vector of strs): a list of the names of each
 *        property
 *     settings (SWIG map of strs to strs): a general property map .
 *
 * .. note::
 *
 *     Because the bindings are generated by SWIG, you can access the members

 *     len(), append(), and indexing via [] are useful. Some other methods like
 *     resize() and iterators are also provided.  However, you CANNOT set these
 *     items via assignment, i.e., ``pc.vertices = [0,0,0]`` is not allowed. 
 *
 * Property names are usually lowercase but follow PCL naming convention, and 
 * often include:
 *
 * - ``normal_x``, ``normal_y``, ``normal_z``: the outward normal 
 * - ``rgb``, ``rgba``: integer encoding of RGB (24 bit int, format 0xrrggbb)
 *   or RGBA color (32 bit int, format 0xaarrggbb) 
 * - ``opacity``: opacity, in range [0,1]
 * - ``c``: opacity, in range [0,255]
 * - ``r,g,b,a``: color channels, in range [0,1]
 * - ``u,v``: texture coordinate
 * - ``radius``: treats the point cloud as a collection of balls 
 * 
 * Settings are usually lowercase but follow PCL naming convention, and often
 * include:
 *
 * - ``version``: version of the PCL file, typically "0.7" 
 * - ``id``: integer id
 * - ``width``: the width (in pixels) of a structured point cloud
 * - ``height``: the height (in pixels) of a structured point cloud
 * - ``viewpoint``: Camera position and orientation in the form 
 *   ``ox oy oz qw qx qy qz``, with (ox,oy,oz) the focal point and 
 *   (qw,qx,qy,qz) the quaternion representation of the orientation (canonical
 *   representation, with X right, Y down, Z forward).
 *
 * Examples::
 * 
 *     pc = PointCloud()
 *     pc.propertyNames.append('rgb')
 *     #add 1 point with coordinates (0,0,0) and color #000000 (black)
 *     pc.vertices.append(0)
 *     pc.vertices.append(0)
 *     pc.vertices.append(0)
 *     pc.properties.append(0)
 *     print(len(pc.vertices)) #prints 3
 *     print(pc.numPoints())   #prints 1
 *     #add another point with coordinates (1,2,3)
 *     pc.addPoint([1,2,3])
 *     #this prints 2
 *     print(pc.numPoints() )
 *     print(pc.getPoints())   #prints [[0,0,0],[1,2,3]]
 *     #this prints 2, because there is 1 property category x 2 points
 *     print(pc.properties.size())
 *     assert pc.propertyNames.size() == pc.getAllProperties().shape[1]
 *     #this prints 0; this is the default value added when addPoint is called
 *     print(pc.getProperty(1,0) )
 *
 * To get all points as an n x 3 numpy array::
 *
 *     points = pc.getPoints()
 * 
 * To get all properties as a n x k numpy array::
 *
 *     properties = pc.getAllProperties()

/** @brief The three-D geometry container used throughout Klampt.  
 *
 * There are five currently supported types of geometry:
 *
 * - primitives (:class:`GeometricPrimitive`)
 * - triangle meshes (:class:`TriangleMesh`)
 * - point clouds (:class:`PointCloud`)
 * - volumetric grids (:class:`VolumeGrid`)
 * - groups ("Group" type)
 * - convex hulls (:class:`ConvexHull`)
 * 
 * This class acts as a uniform container of all of these types.
 *
 * There are two modes in which a Geometry3D can be used.  It can be a
 * standalone geometry, which means it is a container of geometry data,
 * or it can be a reference to a world item's geometry.  For references,
 * modifiers change the world item's geometry.
 *
 * **Current transform**
 *
 * Each geometry stores a "current" transform, which is automatically
 * updated for world items' geometries.  Proximity queries are then
 * performed *with respect to the transformed geometries*.  Crucially, the
 * underlying geometry is not changed, because that could be computationally
 * expensive. 
 *
 * **Creating / modifying the geometry**
 *
 * Use the constructor, the :meth:`set`, or the set[TYPE]() methods to
 * completely change the geometry's data.
 *
 * Note: if you want to set a world item's geometry to be equal to a standalone
 * geometry, use the set(rhs) function rather than the assignment (=)
 * operator.
 *
 * Modifiers include:
 * 
 * - :meth:`setCurrentTransform`: updates the current transform.  (This call is
 *   very fast.)
 * - :meth:`translate`, :meth:`scale`, :meth:`rotate`, and :meth:`transform`
 *   transform the underlying geometry.  Any collision data structures will
 *   be recomputed after transformation. 
 * - :meth:`loadFile`: load from OFF, OBJ, STL, PCD, etc.  Also supports native
 *   Klamp't types .geom and .vol.
 * 
 * .. note::
 *
 *     Avoid the use of translate, rotate, and transform to represent object
 *     movement.  Use setCurrentTransform instead.
 *
 * **Proximity queries**
 * 
 * - :meth:`collides`: boolean collision query.
 * - :meth:`withinDistance`: boolean proximity query.
 * - :meth:`distance` and :meth:`distance_ext`: numeric-valued distance query.
 *   The distance may be negative to indicate signed distance, available for
 *   certain geometry types. Also returns closest points for certain geometry
 *   types.
 * - :meth:`distance_point` and :meth:`distance_point_ext`: numeric valued
 *   distance-to-point queries.
 * - :meth:`contacts`: estimates the contact region between two objects.
 * - :meth:`rayCast` and :meth:`rayCast_ext`: ray-cast queries.
 *
 * For most geometry types (TriangleMesh, PointCloud, ConvexHull), the
 * first time you perform a query, some collision detection data structures
 * will be initialized.  This preprocessing step can take some time for complex
 * geometries.
 *
 * **Collision margins**
 * 
 * Each object also has a "collision margin" which may virtually fatten the
 * object, as far as proximity queries are concerned. This is useful
 * for setting collision avoidance margins in motion planning.  Use the
 * :meth:`setCollisionMargin` and :meth:`getCollisionMargin` methods to access
 * the margin. By default the margin is zero. 
 *
 * .. note::
 *
 *     The geometry margin is NOT the same thing as simulation body collision
 *     padding!  All proximity queries are affected by the collision padding,
 *     inside or outside of simulation.
 *
 * **Conversions**
 *
 * Many geometry types can be converted to and from one another using the
 * :meth:`convert` method.  This can also be used to remesh TriangleMesh
 * objects and PointCloud objects.

  /** @brief Converts a geometry to another type, if a conversion is
   * available.  The interpretation of param depends on the type of
   * conversion, with 0 being a reasonable default.
   *
   * Available conversions are:
   *
   *   - TriangleMesh -> PointCloud.  param is the desired dispersion of
   *        the points, by default set to the average triangle diameter. 
   *        At least all of the mesh's vertices will be returned.
   *   - TriangleMesh -> VolumeGrid.  Converted using the fast marching
   *        method with good results only if the mesh is watertight.
   *        param is the grid resolution, by default set to the average
   *        triangle diameter.
   *   - TriangleMesh -> ConvexHull.  If param==0, just calculates a convex
   *        hull. Otherwise, uses convex decomposition with the HACD library.
   *   - PointCloud -> TriangleMesh. Available if the point cloud is
   *        structured. param is the threshold for splitting triangles
   *        by depth discontinuity. param is by default infinity.
   *   - PointCloud -> ConvexHull.  Converted using SOLID / Qhull.
   *   - GeometricPrimitive -> anything.  param determines the desired
   *        resolution.
   *   - VolumeGrid -> TriangleMesh.  param determines the level set for
   *         the marching cubes algorithm.
   *   - VolumeGrid -> PointCloud.  param determines the level set.
   *   - ConvexHull -> TriangleMesh. 
   *   - ConvexHull -> PointCloud.  param is the desired dispersion of the
   *         points.  Equivalent to ConvexHull -> TriangleMesh -> PointCloud
