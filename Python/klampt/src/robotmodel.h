/** @brief A model of a dynamic and kinematic robot.
 *
 * Stores both constant information, like the reference placement of the links,
 * joint limits, velocity limits, etc, as well as a *current configuration*
 * and *current velocity* which are state-dependent.  Several functions depend
 * on the robot's current configuration and/or velocity.  To update that, use
 * the setConfig() and setVelocity() functions.  setConfig() also update's the
 * robot's link transforms via forward kinematics.  You may also use setDOFPosition
 * and setDOFVelocity for individual changes, but these are more expensive because
 * each call updates all of the affected the link transforms.
 *
 * It is important to understand that changing the configuration of the model
 * doesn't actually send a command to the physical / simulated robot.  Moreover,
 * the model does not automatically get updated when the physical / simulated
 * robot moves.  In essence, the model maintains temporary storage for performing
 * kinematics, dynamics, and planning computations, as well as for visualization.
 * 
 * The state of the robot is retrieved using getConfig/getVelocity calls, and
 * is set using setConfig/setVelocity.  Because many routines change the robot's
 * configuration, like IK and motion planning, a common design pattern is to
 * save/restore the configuration as follows::
 * 
 *     q = robot.getConfig()
 *     do some stuff that may touch the robot's configuration...
 *     robot.setConfig(q)
 *
 * The model maintains configuration/velocity/acceleration/torque limits.
 * However, these are not enforced by the model, so you can happily set
 * configurations outside the limits. Valid commands must rather be enforced 
 * by the planner / controller / simulator.
 * 
 * As elsewhere in Klampt, the mapping between links and drivers is not one-to
 * one. A driver is essentially an actuator and transmission, and for most links
 * a link is driven by a unique driver (e.g., a motor and gearbox). However,
 * there do exist certain cases in which a link is not driven at all (e.g., the
 * 6 virtual links of a floating-base robot), or multiple links are driven by
 * a single actuator (e.g., a parallel-bar mechanism or a compliant hand). 
 * There are also unusual drivers that introduce underactuated dynamics into
 * the system, such as a differential drive or Dubin's car mobile base.   Care
 * must be taken when sending commands to motor controllers (e.g., Klampt
 * Robot Interface Layer), which often work in the actuator space rather than
 * joint space.  (See :func:`configToDrivers`, :func:`configFromDrivers`,
 * :func:`velocityToDrivers`, :func:`velocityFromDrivers`).

 *
 * .. note:
 * 
 *     Although a WorldModel instance is typically called a "world" it is
 *     just a model and does not have to reflect the state of a physical world.
 *     The state of robots and objects in the world can be changed at will --
 *     in fact planners and simulators will query and modify the state of a
 *     WorldModel during their operation.
 * 
 *     To keep around some "authoritative" world, you can keep around a copy
 *     (use ``WorldModel.copy()``) or ``config.getConfig(world)`` using the
 *     :mod:`klampt.model.config` module.
 *
 * Every robot/robot link/terrain/rigid object is given a unique ID in the
 * world.  This is potentially a source of confusion because some functions
 * take IDs and some take indices.  Only the WorldModel and Simulator
 * classes use IDs when the argument has 'id' as a suffix, e.g., geometry(),
 * appearance(), Simulator.inContact().
 * All other functions use indices, e.g. robot(0), terrain(0), etc.
 *
 * To get an object's ID, you can see the value returned by loadElement
 * and/or object.getID().  
 * states.
 *
 * To save/restore the state of the model, you must manually maintain copies of
 * the states of whichever objects you wish to save/restore.
