%feature("docstring") Appearance "

Geometry appearance information. Supports vertex/edge/face rendering, per-vertex
color, and basic color texture mapping. Uses OpenGL display lists, so repeated
calls are fast.  

For more complex appearances, you will need to call your own OpenGL calls.  

Appearances can be either references to appearances of objects in the world, or
they can be standalone.  

Performance note: Avoid rebuilding buffers (e.g., via :meth:`refresh`) as much
as possible.

%feature("docstring") CSpaceInterface "

A raw interface for a configuration space.  

..note::  

    The native Python CSpace interface class in cspace.py is easier to use.  

You can either set a single feasibility test function using setFeasibility() or
add several feasibility tests, all of which need to be satisfied, using
addFeasibilityTest(). In the latter case, planners may be able to provide
debugging statistics, solve Minimum Constraint Removal problems, run faster by
eliminating constraint tests, etc.  

Either setVisibility() or setVisibilityEpsilon() must be called to define a
visibility checker between two (feasible) configurations. In the latter case,
the path will be discretized at the resolution sent to setVisibilityEpsilon. If
you have special single-constraint visibility tests, you can call that using
addVisibilityTest (for example, for convex constraints you can set it to the
lambda function that returns true regardless of its arguments).  

Supported properties include \"euclidean\" (boolean), \"metric\" (string),
\"geodesic\" (boolean), \"minimum\" (vector), and \"maximum\" (vector). These
may be used by planners to make planning faster or more accurate. For a complete
list see KrisLibrary/planning/CSpace.h.

%feature("docstring") Geometry3D "

The three-D geometry container used throughout Klampt.  

There are five currently supported types of geometry:  

*   primitives (:class:`GeometricPrimitive`)  
*   triangle meshes (:class:`TriangleMesh`)  
*   point clouds (:class:`PointCloud`)  
*   volumetric grids (:class:`VolumeGrid`)  
*   groups (\"Group\" type)  
*   convex hulls (:class:`ConvexHull`)  

This class acts as a uniform container of all of these types.  

There are two modes in which a Geometry3D can be used. It can be a standalone
geometry, which means it is a container of geometry data, or it can be a
reference to a world item's geometry. For references, modifiers change the world
item's geometry.  

**Current transform**  

Each geometry stores a \"current\" transform, which is automatically updated for
world items' geometries. Proximity queries are then performed *with respect to
the transformed geometries*. Crucially, the underlying geometry is not changed,
because that could be computationally expensive.  

**Creating / modifying the geometry**  

Use the constructor, the :meth:`set`, or the set[TYPE]() methods to completely
change the geometry's data.  

Note: if you want to set a world item's geometry to be equal to a standalone
geometry, use the set(rhs) function rather than the assignment (=) operator.  

Modifiers include:  

*   :meth:`setCurrentTransform`: updates the current transform. (This call is
    very fast.)  
*   :meth:`translate`, :meth:`scale`, :meth:`rotate`, and :meth:`transform`
    transform the underlying geometry. Any collision data structures will be
    recomputed after transformation.  
*   :meth:`loadFile`: load from OFF, OBJ, STL, PCD, etc. Also supports native
    Klamp't types .geom and .vol.  

.. note::  

    Avoid the use of translate, rotate, and transform to represent object
    movement.  Use setCurrentTransform instead.  

**Proximity queries**  

*   :meth:`collides`: boolean collision query.  
*   :meth:`withinDistance`: boolean proximity query.  
*   :meth:`distance` and :meth:`distance_ext`: numeric-valued distance query.
    The distance may be negative to indicate signed distance, available for
    certain geometry types. Also returns closest points for certain geometry
    types.  
*   :meth:`distance_point` and :meth:`distance_point_ext`: numeric valued
    distance-to-point queries.  
*   :meth:`contacts`: estimates the contact region between two objects.  
*   :meth:`rayCast` and :meth:`rayCast_ext`: ray-cast queries.  

For most geometry types (TriangleMesh, PointCloud, ConvexHull), the first time
you perform a query, some collision detection data structures will be
initialized. This preprocessing step can take some time for complex geometries.  

**Collision margins**  

Each object also has a \"collision margin\" which may virtually fatten the
object, as far as proximity queries are concerned. This is useful for setting
collision avoidance margins in motion planning. Use the
:meth:`setCollisionMargin` and :meth:`getCollisionMargin` methods to access the
margin. By default the margin is zero.  

.. note::  

    The geometry margin is NOT the same thing as simulation body collision
    padding!  All proximity queries are affected by the collision padding,
    inside or outside of simulation.  

**Conversions**  

Many geometry types can be converted to and from one another using the
:meth:`convert` method. This can also be used to remesh TriangleMesh objects and
PointCloud objects.  

C++ includes: geometry.h
";

%feature("docstring") Geometry3D::set "

";

%feature("docstring") Geometry3D::setCurrentTransform "

";

%feature("docstring") Geometry3D::roi "

Calculates a region of interest of the data for the bounding box [bmin,bmax].
The geometry's current transform is respected.  

`query` can be \"intersect\", \"touching\", or \"within\". If \"intersect\",
this tries to get a representation of the geometry intersecting the box. If
\"touching\", all elements touching the box are returned. If \"within\", only
elements entirely inside the box are returned.  

`query` can also be prefaced with a '~' which indicates that the ROI should be
inverted, i.e. select everything that does NOT intersect with a box.  

O(N) time.

";

%feature("docstring") IKSolver::minimize "

Tries to find a configuration that satifies all simultaneous objectives up to
the desired tolerance or minimizes the residual.  

The relation to `:func:solve` is that `solve` uses a root-finding method that
tries indirectly to minimize the residual, but it may stall out when the
objectives are infeasible.  

If secondary objectives are specified, this tries to minimize them once the
primary objectives are satisfied, i.e., it will minimize on the solution
manifold of the primary constraints.  

There are two flavors of secondary objectives. If no arguments are given, then
any constraints added via `addSecondary` will have their residuals minimized.  

If the user provides a pair of functions `(f,grad)`, then a custom objective is
specified. Here, `f(q)` is the secondary objective to minimize and `grad(q)` its
gradient. This will override the secondary objectives added via `addSecondary`.
Specifically, q is a function of all robot DOFs, and `grad(q)` should return a
list or tuple of length `len(q)``.  

.. note::  

    The minimization will occur only over the current active DOFs, which will
    include default active DOFs for secondary objectives.  

Arguments: secondary_objective (callable): a function `f(q)->float` that should
be minimized. secondary_objective_grad (callable): a function
`grad(q)->`sequence of length `len(q)` giving the gradient of `f` at `q`.

    True if x converged on the primary objectives.

%feature("docstring") PlannerInterface "

An interface for a kinematic motion planner. The :class:`MotionPlan` interface
in cspace.py is somewhat easier to use.  

On construction, uses the planner type specified by setPlanType and the settings
currently specified by calls to setPlanSetting.  

Point-to-point planning is enabled by sending two configurations to the
setEndpoints method. This is mandatory for RRT and SBL-style planners. The start
and end milestones are given by indices 0 and 1, respectively  

Point-to-set planning is enabled by sending a *goal test* as the second argument
to the setEndpoints method. It is possible also to send a special goal sampler
by providing a *pair of functions* as the second argument consisting of the two
functions (goaltest,goalsample). The first in this pair tests whether a
configuration is a goal, and the second returns a sampled configuration in a
superset of the goal. Ideally the goal sampler generates as many goals as
possible.  

To plan, call planMore(iters) until getPath(0,1) returns non-NULL. The return
value is a list of configurations.  

Some planners can be used multi-query mode (such as PRM). In multi-query mode,
you may call addMilestone(q) to add a new milestone. addMilestone() returns the
index of that milestone, which can be used in later calls to getPath().  

In point-to-set mode, getSolutionPath will return the optimal path to any goal
milestone.  

All planners work with the standard path-length objective function. Some
planners can work with other cost functions, and you can use setCostFunction to
set the edge / terminal costs. Usually, the results will only be optimal on the
computed graph, and the graph is not specifically computed to optimize that
cost.  

To get a roadmap (V,E), call getRoadmap(). V is a list of configurations (each
configuration is a Python list) and E is a list of edges (each edge is a pair
(i,j) indexing into V).  

To dump the roadmap to disk, call dump(fn). This saves to a Trivial Graph Format
(TGF) format.

%feature("docstring") PointCloud "

A 3D point cloud class.  

Attributes:  

    vertices (SWIG vector of floats): a list of vertices, given as a
        list [x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, ... zn]
    properties (SWIG vector of floats): a list of vertex properties,
       given as a list [p11, p21, ..., pk1,  p12, p22, ..., pk2, ...,
       p1n, p2n, ..., pkn] where each vertex has k properties.  The
       name of each property is given by the ``propertyNames`` member.
    propertyNames (SWIG vector of strs): a list of the names of each
       property
    settings (SWIG map of strs to strs): a general property map .  

.. note::  

    Because the bindings are generated by SWIG, you can access the members
    via some automatically generated accessors / modifiers.  In particular
    len(), append(), and indexing via [] are useful. Some other methods like
    resize() and iterators are also provided.  However, you CANNOT set these
    items via assignment, i.e., ``pc.vertices = [0,0,0]`` is not allowed.  

Property names are usually lowercase but follow PCL naming convention, and often
include:  

*   `normal_x`, `normal_y`, `normal_z`: the outward normal  
*   `rgb`, `rgba`: integer encoding of RGB (24 bit int, format 0xrrggbb) or RGBA
    color (32 bit int, format 0xaarrggbb)  
*   `opacity`: opacity, in range [0,1]  
*   `c`: opacity, in range [0,255]  
*   `r,g,b,a`: color channels, in range [0,1]  
*   `u,v`: texture coordinate  
*   `radius`: treats the point cloud as a collection of balls  

Settings are usually lowercase but follow PCL naming convention, and often
include:  

*   `version`: version of the PCL file, typically \"0.7\"  
*   `id`: integer id  
*   `width`: the width (in pixels) of a structured point cloud  
*   `height`: the height (in pixels) of a structured point cloud  
*   `viewpoint`: Camera position and orientation in the form `ox oy oz qw qx qy
    qz`, with (ox,oy,oz) the focal point and (qw,qx,qy,qz) the quaternion
    representation of the orientation (canonical representation, with X right, Y
    down, Z forward).  

Examples::  

    pc = PointCloud()
    pc.propertyNames.append('rgb')
    #add 1 point with coordinates (0,0,0) and color #000000 (black)
    pc.vertices.append(0)
    pc.vertices.append(0)
    pc.vertices.append(0)
    pc.properties.append(0)
    print(len(pc.vertices)) #prints 3
    print(pc.numPoints())   #prints 1
    #add another point with coordinates (1,2,3)
    pc.addPoint([1,2,3])
    #this prints 2
    print(pc.numPoints() )
    print(pc.getPoints())   #prints [[0,0,0],[1,2,3]]
    #this prints 2, because there is 1 property category x 2 points
    print(pc.properties.size())
    assert pc.propertyNames.size() == pc.getAllProperties().shape[1]
    #this prints 0; this is the default value added when addPoint is called
    print(pc.getProperty(1,0) )  

To get all points as an n x 3 numpy array::  

    points = pc.getPoints()  

To get all properties as a n x k numpy array::  

    properties = pc.getAllProperties()

%feature("docstring") RobotModel "

A model of a dynamic and kinematic robot.  

Stores both constant information, like the reference placement of the links,
joint limits, velocity limits, etc, as well as a *current configuration* and
*current velocity* which are state-dependent. Several functions depend on the
robot's current configuration and/or velocity. To update that, use the
setConfig() and setVelocity() functions. setConfig() also update's the robot's
link transforms via forward kinematics. You may also use setDOFPosition and
setDOFVelocity for individual changes, but these are more expensive because each
call updates all of the affected the link transforms.  

It is important to understand that changing the configuration of the model
doesn't actually send a command to the physical / simulated robot. Moreover, the
model does not automatically get updated when the physical / simulated robot
moves. In essence, the model maintains temporary storage for performing
kinematics, dynamics, and planning computations, as well as for visualization.  

The state of the robot is retrieved using getConfig/getVelocity calls, and is
set using setConfig/setVelocity. Because many routines change the robot's
configuration, like IK and motion planning, a common design pattern is to
save/restore the configuration as follows::  

    q = robot.getConfig()
    do some stuff that may touch the robot's configuration...
    robot.setConfig(q)  

The model maintains configuration/velocity/acceleration/torque limits. However,
these are not enforced by the model, so you can happily set configurations
outside the limits. Valid commands must rather be enforced by the planner /
controller / simulator.  

As elsewhere in Klampt, the mapping between links and drivers is not one-to one.
A driver is essentially an actuator and transmission, and for most links a link
is driven by a unique driver (e.g., a motor and gearbox). However, there do
exist certain cases in which a link is not driven at all (e.g., the 6 virtual
links of a floating-base robot), or multiple links are driven by a single
actuator (e.g., a parallel-bar mechanism or a compliant hand). There are also
unusual drivers that introduce underactuated dynamics into the system, such as a
differential drive or Dubin's car mobile base. Care must be taken when sending
commands to motor controllers (e.g., Klampt Robot Interface Layer), which often
work in the actuator space rather than joint space. (See
:func:`configToDrivers`, :func:`configFromDrivers`, :func:`velocityToDrivers`,
:func:`velocityFromDrivers`).

// File: classSimRobotController.xml


%feature("docstring") SimRobotController "

A controller for a simulated robot.  

By default a SimRobotController has three possible modes:  

*   Motion queue + PID mode: the controller has an internal trajectory queue
    that may be added to and modified. This queue supports piecewise linear
    interpolation, cubic interpolation, and time-optimal move-to commands.  
*   PID mode: the user controls the motor's PID setpoints directly  
*   Torque control: the user controlls the motor torques directly.  

The \"standard\" way of using this is in move-to mode which accepts a milestone
(setMilestone) or list of milestones (repeated calls to addMilestone) and
interpolates dynamically from the current configuration/velocity. To handle
disturbances, a PID loop is run automatically at the controller's specified
rate.  

To get finer-grained control over the motion queue's timing, you may use the
setLinear/setCubic/addLinear/addCubic functions. In these functions it is up to
the user to respect velocity, acceleration, and torque limits.  

Whether in motion queue or PID mode, the constants of the PID loop are initially
set in the robot file. You can programmatically tune these via the setPIDGains
function.  

Arbitrary trajectories can be tracked by using setVelocity over short time
steps. Force controllers can be implemented using setTorque, again using short
time steps.  

If the setVelocity, setTorque, or setPID command are called, the motion queue
behavior will be completely overridden. To reset back to motion queue control,
setManualMode(False) must be called first.  

Individual joints cannot be addressed with mixed motion queue mode and
torque/PID mode. However, you can mix PID and torque mode between different
joints with a workaround::  


   # setup by zeroing out PID constants for torque controlled joints
   pid_joint_indices = [...]
   torque_joint_indices = [...] # complement of pid_joint_indices
   kp,ki,kp = controller.getPIDGains()
   for i in torque_joint_indices:  #turn off PID gains here
      kp[i] = ki[i] = kp[i] = 0  

   # to send PID command (qcmd,dqcmd) and torque commands tcmd, use
   # a PID command with feedforward torques.  First we build a whole-robot
   # command:
   qcmd_whole = [0]*controller.model().numLinks()
   dqcmd_whole = [0]*controller.model().numLinks()
   tcmd_whole = [0]*controller.model().numLinks()
   for i,k in enumerate(pid_joint_indices):
       qcmd_whole[k],dqcmd_whole[i] = qcmd[i],dqcmd[i]
   for i,k in enumerate(torque_joint_indices):
       tcmd_whole[k] = tcmd[i]
   # Then we send it to the controller

%feature("docstring") SimRobotSensor "

A sensor on a simulated robot. Retrieve one from the controller using
:meth:`SimRobotController.sensor`, or create a new one using
:meth:`SimRobotController.addSensor`. You may also use kinematically-simulated
sensors using :meth:`RobotModel.sensor` or create a new one using
:meth:`RobotModel.addSensor`.  

Use :meth:`getMeasurements` to get the currently simulated measurement vector.  

Sensors are automatically updated through the :meth:`Simulator.simulate` call,
and :meth:`getMeasurements` retrieves the updated values. As a result, you may
get garbage measurements before the first Simulator.simulate call is made.  

There is also a mode for doing kinematic simulation, which is supported (i.e.,
makes sensible measurements) for some types of sensors when just a robot / world
model is given. This is similar to Simulation.fakeSimulate but the entire
controller structure is bypassed. You can arbitrarily set the robot's position,
call :meth:`kinematicReset`, and then call :meth:`kinematicSimulate`. Subsequent
calls assume the robot is being driven along a trajectory until the next
:meth:`kinematicReset` is called.  

LaserSensor, CameraSensor, TiltSensor, AccelerometerSensor, GyroSensor,
JointPositionSensor, JointVelocitySensor support kinematic simulation mode.
FilteredSensor and TimeDelayedSensor also work. The force-related sensors
(ContactSensor and ForceTorqueSensor) return 0's in kinematic simulation.  

To use get/setSetting, you will need to know the sensor attribute names and
types as described in `the Klampt sensor documentation
<https://github.com/krishauser/Klampt/blob/master/Cpp/docs/Manual-
Control.md#sensors>`_ (same as in the world or sensor XML file). Common settings
include:  

*   rate (float): how frequently the sensor is simulated  
*   enabled (bool): whether the simulator simulates this sensor  
*   link (int): the link on which this sensor lies (-1 for world)  
*   Tsensor (se3 transform, serialized with loader.write_se3(T)): the transform
    of the sensor on the robot / world.

%feature("docstring") TriangleMesh "

A 3D indexed triangle mesh class.  

Attributes:  

    vertices (SWIG vector of floats):  a list of vertices, given as
        a flattened coordinate list [x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, ...]
    indices (SWIG vector of ints): a list of triangle vertices given
        as indices into the vertices list, i.e., [a1,b1,c2, a2,b2,c2, ...]  

Note: because the bindings are generated by SWIG, you can access the indices /
vertices members via some automatically generated accessors / modifiers. In
particular len(), append(), and indexing via [] are useful. Some other methods
like resize() are also provided. However, you CANNOT set these items via
assignment.  

Examples::  

    m = TriangleMesh()
    m.vertices.append(0)
    m.vertices.append(0)
    m.vertices.append(0)
    print(len(m.vertices))  #prints 3
    m.vertices = [0,0,0]   #this is an error
    m.vertices += [1,2,3]   #this is also an error  

To get all vertices as a numpy array::  

    verts = m.getVertices()

%feature("docstring") VolumeGrid "

An axis-aligned volumetric grid, typically a signed distance transform with > 0
indicating outside and < 0 indicating inside. Can also store an occupancy grid
with 1 indicating inside and 0 indicating outside.  

In general, values are associated with cells rather than vertices. So, cell
(i,j,k) is associated with a single value, and has size (w,d,h) =
((bmax[0]-bmin[0])/dims[0], (bmax[1]-bmin[1])/dims[1],
(bmax[2]-bmin[2])/dims[2]). It ranges over the box [w*i,w*(i+1)) x [d*j,d*(j+1))
x [h*k,h*(k+1)).  

For SDFs and TSDFs which assume values at vertices, the values are specified at
the **centers** of cells. I.e., at (w*(i+1/2),d*(j+1/2),h*(k+1/2)).  

Attributes:  

    bbox (SWIG vector of 6 doubles): contains min and max bounds
        (xmin,ymin,zmin),(xmax,ymax,zmax)
    dims (SWIG vector of  of 3 ints): size of grid in each of 3 dimensions
    values (SWIG vector of doubles): contains a 3D array of
         ``dims[0]*dims[1]*dims[1]`` values.

         The cell index (i,j,k) is flattened to
         ``i*dims[1]*dims[2] + j*dims[2] + k``.

         The array index i is associated to cell index
         ``(i/(dims[1]*dims[2]), (i/dims[2]) % dims[1], i%dims[2])``

// File: classWorldModel.xml


%feature("docstring") WorldModel "

The main world class, containing robots, rigid objects, and static environment
geometry.  

.. note:  

    Although a WorldModel instance is typically called a \"world\" it is
    just a model and does not have to reflect the state of a physical world.
    The state of robots and objects in the world can be changed at will --
    in fact planners and simulators will query and modify the state of a
    WorldModel during their operation.

    To keep around some \"authoritative\" world, you can keep around a copy
    (use ``WorldModel.copy()``) or ``config.getConfig(world)`` using the
    :mod:`klampt.model.config` module.  

Every robot/robot link/terrain/rigid object is given a unique ID in the world.
This is potentially a source of confusion because some functions take IDs and
some take indices. Only the WorldModel and Simulator classes use IDs when the
argument has 'id' as a suffix, e.g., geometry(), appearance(),
Simulator.inContact(). All other functions use indices, e.g. robot(0),
terrain(0), etc.  

To get an object's ID, you can see the value returned by loadElement and/or
object.getID(). states.  

To save/restore the state of the model, you must manually maintain copies of the
states of whichever objects you wish to save/restore.

    have passed.  

    To restart after a certain amount of time has elasped, use
    \"{timeLimit:X}\". If you are using an optimizing planner, e.g.,
    shortcutting, you should set foundSolution:0.
