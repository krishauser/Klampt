// File: classCSpaceInterface.xml
%feature("docstring") CSpaceInterface "

A raw interface for a configuration space. Note: the native Python
CSpace interface class in cspace.py is easier to use.

You can either set a single feasibility test function using
setFeasibility() or add several feasibility tests, all of which need
to be satisfied, using addFeasibilityTest(). In the latter case,
planners may be able to provide debugging statistics, solve Minimum
Constraint Removal problems, run faster by eliminating constraint
tests, etc.

Either setVisibility() or setVisibilityEpsilon() must be called to
define a visibility checker between two (feasible) configurations. In
the latter case, the path will be discretized at the resolution sent
to setVisibilityEpsilon. If you have special single-constraint
visibility tests, you can call that using addVisibilityTest (for
example, for convex constraints you can set it to the lambda function
that returns true regardless of its arguments).

Supported properties include \"euclidean\" (boolean), \"metric\"
(string), \"geodesic\" (boolean), \"minimum\" (vector), and
\"maximum\" (vector). These may be used by planners to make planning
faster or more accurate. For a complete list see
KrisLibrary/planning/CSpace.h.

%feature("docstring") Geometry3D "

A three-D geometry. Can either be a reference to a world item's
geometry, in which case modifiers change the world item's geometry, or
it can be a standalone geometry.

There are four currently supported types of geometry: primitives (
GeometricPrimitive)

triangle meshes ( TriangleMesh)

point clouds ( PointCloud)

groups (Group) This class acts as a uniform container of all of these
types.

Each geometry stores a \"current\" transform, which is automatically
updated for world items' geometries. The proximity queries are
performed with respect to the transformed geometries (note the
underlying geometry is not changed, which could be computationally
expensive. The query is performed, however, as though they were).

If you want to set a world item's geometry to be equal to a standalone
geometry, use the set(rhs) function rather than the assignment (=)
operator.

Modifiers include any setX() functions, translate(), and transform().

Proximity queries include collides(), withinDistance(), distance(),
closestPoint(), and rayCast().

Each object also has a \"collision margin\" which may virtually fatten
the object, as far as proximity queries are concerned. This is useful
for setting collision avoidance margins in motion planning. By default
it is zero. (Note that this is NOT the same thing as simulation body
collision padding!)

// File: classPlannerInterface.xml
%feature("docstring") PlannerInterface "

An interface for a motion planner. The MotionPlanner interface in
cspace.py is somewhat easier to use.

On construction, uses the planner type specified by setPlanType and
the settings currently specified by calls to setPlanSetting.

Point-to-point planning is enabled by sending two configurations to
the setEndpoints method. This is mandatory for RRT and SBL-style
planners. The start and end milestones are given by indices 0 and 1,
respectively

Point-to-set planning is enabled by sending a goal test as the second
argument to the setEndpoints method. It is possible also to send a
special goal sampler by providing a pair of functions as the second
argument consisting of the two functions (goaltest,goalsample). The
first in this pair tests whether a configuration is a goal, and the
second returns a sampled configuration in a superset of the goal.
Ideally the goal sampler generates as many goals as possible.

PRM can be used in either point-to-point or multi-query mode. In
multi-query mode, you may call addMilestone(q) to add a new milestone.
addMilestone() returns the index of that milestone, which can be used
in later calls to getPath().

To plan, call planMore(iters) until getPath(0,1) returns non-NULL. The
return value is a list of configurations.

To get a roadmap (V,E), call getRoadmap(). V is a list of
configurations (each configuration is a Python list) and E is a list
of edges (each edge is a pair (i,j) indexing into V).

To dump the roadmap to disk, call dump(fn). This saves to a Trivial
Graph Format (TGF) format.

A 3D point cloud class.

Attributes: vertices: a list of vertices, given as a list [x1, y1, z1,
x2, y2, ... zn]

properties: a list of vertex properties, given as a list [p11, p21,
..., pk1, p12, p22, ..., pk2, ... , pn1, pn2, ..., pn2] where each
vertex has k properties. The name of each property is given by the
propertyNames member.

Note: because the bindings are generated by SWIG, you can access the
vertices/properties/propertyName members via some automatically
generated accessors / modifiers. In particular len(), append(), and
indexing via [] are useful. Some other methods like resize() are also
provided. However, you CANNOT set these items via assignment.

Examples:

// File: classRobotModel.xml
%feature("docstring") RobotModel "

A model of a dynamic and kinematic robot.

Stores both constant information, like the reference placement of the
links, joint limits, velocity limits, etc, as well as a current
configuration and current velocity which are state-dependent. Several
functions depend on the robot's current configuration and/or velocity.
To update that, use the setConfig() and setVelocity() functions.
setConfig() also update's the robot's link transforms via forward
kinematics. You may also use setDOFPosition and setDOFVelocity for
individual changes, but this is more expensive because each call
updates all of the affected the link transforms.

It is important to understand that changing the configuration of the
model doesn't actually send a command to the physical / simulated
robot. Moreover, the model does not automatically get updated when the
physical / simulated robot moves. In essence, the model maintains
temporary storage for performing kinematics, dynamics, and planning
computations, as well as for visualization.

The state of the robot is retrieved using getConfig/getVelocity calls,
and is set using setConfig/setVelocity. Because many routines change
the robot's configuration, like IK and motion planning, a common
design pattern is to save/restore the configuration as follows: q =
robot.getConfig()

do some stuff that may touch the robot's configuration...

robot.setConfig(q)

The model maintains configuration/velocity/acceleration/torque bounds.
However, these are not enforced by the model, so you can happily set
configurations outside must rather be enforced by the planner /
simulator.

// File: classSimRobotController.xml
%feature("docstring") SimRobotController "

A controller for a simulated robot.

By default a SimRobotController has three possible modes: Motion queue
+ PID mode: the controller has an internal trajectory queue that may
be added to and modified. This queue supports piecewise linear
interpolation, cubic interpolation, and time-optimal move-to commands.

PID mode: the user controls the motor's PID setpoints directly

Torque control: the user controlls the motor torques directly.

The \"standard\" way of using this is in move-to mode which accepts a
milestone (setMilestone) or list of milestones (repeated calls to
addMilestone) and interpolates dynamically from the current
configuration/velocity. To handle disturbances, a PID loop is run
automatically at the controller's specified rate.

To get finer-grained control over the motion queue's timing, you may
use the setLinear/setCubic/addLinear/addCubic functions. In these
functions it is up to the user to respect velocity, acceleration, and
torque limits.

Whether in motion queue or PID mode, the constants of the PID loop are
initially set in the robot file. You can programmatically tune these
via the setPIDGains function.

Arbitrary trajectories can be tracked by using setVelocity over short
time steps. Force controllers can be implemented using setTorque,
again using short time steps.

If setVelocity, setTorque, or setPID command are called, the motion
queue behavior will be completely overridden. To reset back to motion
queue control, the function setManualMode(False) must be called.

%feature("docstring") SimRobotSensor "

A sensor on a simulated robot. Retreive this from the controller, and
use getMeasurements to get the currently simulated measurement vector.

Sensors are automatically updated through the sim.simulate call, and
getMeasurements() retrieves the previously updated values. As a
result, you may get garbage measurements before the first sim.simulate
call is made.

There is also a new mode for doing kinematic simulation, which is
supported (i.e., makes sensible measurements) for some types of
sensors when just a robot / world model is given. This is similar to
Simulation.fakeSimulate but the entire controller structure is
bypassed. You can randomly set the robot's position, call
kinematicReset(), and then call kinematicSimulate(). Subsequent calls
assume the robot is being driven along a trajectory until the next
kinematicReset() is called. LaserSensor, CameraSensor, TiltSensor,
AccelerometerSensor, GyroSensor, JointPositionSensor,
JointVelocitySensor support kinematic simulation mode. FilteredSensor
and TimeDelayedSensor also work. The force-related sensors
(ContactSensor and ForceTorqueSensor) return 0's in kinematic

indices: a list of triangle vertices given as indices into the
vertices list, i.e., [a1,b1,c2, a2,b2,c2, ...]

Note: because the bindings are generated by SWIG, you can access the
indices / vertices members via some automatically generated accessors
/ modifiers. In particular len(), append(), and indexing via [] are
useful. Some other methods like resize() are also provided. However,
you CANNOT set these items via assignment.

Examples:

m = TriangleMesh() m.vertices.append(0) m.vertices.append(0)
m.vertices.append(0) print len(m.vertices) #prints 3 m.vertices =
[0,0,0] #this is an error m.vertices += [1,2,3] #this is also an error

The main world class, containing robots, rigid objects, and static
environment geometry.

Note that this is just a model and can be changed at will in fact
planners and simulators will make use of a model to \"display\"
computed

Every robot/robot link/terrain/rigid object is given a unique ID in
the world. This is potentially a source of confusion because some
functions take IDs and some take indices. Only the WorldModel and
Simulator classes use IDs when the argument has 'id' as a suffix,
e.g., geometry(), appearance(), Simulator.inContact(). All other
functions use indices, e.g. robot(0), terrain(0), etc.

To get an object's ID, you can see the value returned by loadElement
and/or object.getID(). states.

To save/restore the state of the model, you must manually maintain
copies of the states of whichever objects you wish to save/restore.
