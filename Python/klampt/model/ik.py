"""Inverse kinematics methods.  These use the underlying C++ solver in
Klamp't.  Compared to the SWIG bindings in robotik.h, these helpers
are more convenient (and Pythonic). 

The IK solver is a Newton-Raphson solver, which acts like a local
optimization.  It starts from the robot model's initial configuration
and takes a number of iterations to seek the objective.  The solution
is placed in the robot model's configuration.  If successful, the
solution is also guaranteed to satisfy the robot's joint limits.

For basic IK, the calling sequence is::

    link = robot.link("name")
    goal = ik.objective(link,local=[p1,p2,p3],world=[r1,r2,r3])
    robot.setConfig(startConfig)  #(optional, set the initial configuration)
    if ik.solve(goal):
        print("Hooray, IK solved")
        print("Resulting config:",robot.getConfig())
    else:
        print("IK failed")
        print("Final config:",robot.getConfig())

Here, the points p1,...,p3 on the link (specified in local coordinates)
will be matched to the points r1,...,r3 in the world.  You can also
directly constrain the translation/rotation of the link via the form::
    
    ik.objective(link,R=link.getTransform()[0],t=[x,y,z])
    
which will keep the orientation of the link constant, while setting its
position.

A convenience function is ik.fixed_objective(link) which fixes the position
of the link in its current position/orientation in world coordinates.
Individual points on the link can be constrained to their coordinates using
the local argument, as follows::

    ik.fixed_objective(link,local=[p1,p2,p3])

or if you prefer to give world coordinates, like so::

    ik.fixed_objective(link,world=[q1,q2,q3])

More advanced usage can constrain a link to another link using the ref
argument to ik.objective().  You may also pass multiple goals to ik.solve().

For more control over the solution process, you may use a ik.solver() object.
This object will let you set the active degrees of freedom, get the residual
and Jacobian, and sample random initial solutions.  (see
klampt.robotsim.IKSolver)

    1. By default, the active degrees of freedom are all ancestors of
       the constrained links.  For more control, set them using a solver
       object.
    2. As with any local IK method, Newton-Raphson has a tendency to get
       stuck in local minima.  As a result you may wish to choose random
       initial configurations if the first solve fails.

.. note::
    IK solving with constraints between robot links and rigid objects
    (GeneralizedIKObjective and GeneralizedIKSolver)
    is not yet implemented and will result in an exception.
    This functionality may be supported in the future but is not on the
    current development path.

    There are two modes in which this can be used:

    1. If `local` and `world` are provided, then this objective asks to match 
       the local point (s) on the body to the world point(s).
    2. If `R` and `t` are provided, then the objective is set to specify the
       transform of the body.

    If `ref` is given, then this is the target frame; otherwise it's the world
    frame.  In mode 1, the world points are bound to this frame; in mode 2,
    the transformation from body to ref is specified as (R,t).

    Args:
        body (RobotModelLink or RigidObjectModel): the link that should be
            constrained.
        ref (RobotModelLink or RigidObjectModel, optional): the link that
            `body` should be constrained to, or None for the world frame.
        local (3-vector, or a list of 3-vectors, optional): the local 
            coordinates on `body` should be constrained to the corresponding
            points in `world`
        world (3-vector, or a list of 3-vectors, optional): the coordinates
            to which the points in `local` should be constrained. These are
            given in world coordinates (if `ref`=None) or in `ref`'s frame.
        R (so3 element; list of 9 floats, optional): the rotation that the
            link should take on.
        t (3-vector, optional): the translation that the link's origin
        should take on.

    Returns:
        An IK objective describing the constraint.

        objectives: either a single IKObjective or a list of IKObjectives.
        iters (int, optional): a maximum number of iterations.
        tol (float, optional): a maximum error tolerance on satisfying the
            objectives
        activeDofs (list, optional): a list of link indices or names to use for
            IK solving.  By default, will determine these automatically.
        secondary (IKObjective or list of IKObjective or tuple (func,gradient),
            optional): if given, tries to optimize a secondary objective.  If a
            tuple, it provides both a function and its gradient.

        True if a solution is successfully found to the given tolerance,

        to the solution configuration.  If a solution is not found, False is
        returned and the robot(s) are set to the best found configuration.

    This function will be smart about multiple objects / robots.  If the
    objectives are on disjoint robots then disjoint IK problems will be
    solved individually, which is fater.
    
    (The objectives should be a result from the :func:`objective` function.
    Beware that if you are making your own goals by calling the IKObjective
    constructors from the robotsim module, the .robot member of these goals
    must be set).
