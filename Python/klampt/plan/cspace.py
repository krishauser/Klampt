"""This module provides convenient access to the motionplanning module
   functionality by defining the CSpace and MotionPlan classes."""

import motionplanning
import random

class CSpace:
    """Used alongside MotionPlan to define a configuration space for
    motion planning.

    Attributes:
    - eps: the collision tolerance used for checking edges, in the units
      defined by the distance(a,b) method.  (by default, euclidean distance)
    - bound: a list of lower and upper bounds on the space [(l1,u1),...,(ld,ud)]
      where d is the dimension of the configuration space.
    - properties: a map of properties that may be used by a planner.  See below
      documentation for more detail. 
    Internally used attributes:
    - cspace: a motionplanning module CSpaceInterface object
    - feasibilityTests: a list of one-argument functions that test feasibility
      of this configuration space's constraints.  E.g.,
      if you have a collision tester that returns True if a configuration is in
      collision, and also want to check bounds, you can set this to a list:
      [self.in_bounds,lambda x not self.collides(x)]
      You should not write this directly but instead use addFeasibilityTest.
    - feasibilityTestNames: a list of names of feasibility tests.  You should
      not write this directly but instead use addFeasibilityTest.

    To define a custom CSpace, subclasses will need to override:
        
    - *feasible(x): returns true if the vector x is in the feasible space.  By
      default calls each function in self.feasibilityTests, which by default
      only tests bound constraints.
    - *sample(): returns a new vector x from a superset of the feasible space
    - *sampleneighborhood(c,r): returns a new vector x from a neighborhood of c
      with radius r
    - *visible(a,b): returns true if the path between a and b is feasible
    - *distance(a,b): return a distance between a and b
    - *interpolate(a,b,u): interpolate between a, b with parameter u
    (* indicates an optional override.)

    To avoid memory leaks, CSpace.close() or motionplanning.destroy() must
    be called when you are done.  (The latter deallocates all previously
    created cspaces and planners)

    If sample() is not defined, then subclasses should set self.bound to be a
    list of pairs defining an axis-aligned bounding box.  The setBounds method
    is a convenient way of defining this.

    If visible() is not defined, then paths are checked by subdivision, with
    the collision tolerance self.eps.

    To help planners know a bit more about the CSpace, you can set the
    self.properties member to a map from strings to values.  Useful values
    are
    
    - euclidean (0 or 1): indicates a euclidean space
    - geodesic (0 or 1): indicates whether the interpolation is along
      geodesics.
    - volume (real): a size of the space
    - minimum, maximum (real array): bounds on the space
    - metric (string): the metric used by distance, can be "euclidean",
      "weighted euclidean", "manhattan", "weighted manhattan", "Linf", etc.
    - metricWeights (real array): weights used by weighted metrics
    
    volume is necessary for Lazy PRM* and Lazy RRG* to work.
    
    metricWeights is necessary for KD-tree point location structures to work,
    for FMM methods to work, etc.

    minimum/maximum can be used by grid-based methods (optional for FMM, FMM*).
