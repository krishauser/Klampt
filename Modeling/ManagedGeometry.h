/** @brief A "smart" geometry loading class that caches previous geometries,
 * and does not re-load or re-initialize existing collision detection data
 * structures if the item has already been loaded.
 *
 * Note: the standard Load function will load a file if it hasn't been loaded
 * before, or if it has, it will copy the existing data structures from
 * a prior loaded value.  If the collision data structure of the prior
 * geometry haven't been created, they will be created and copied to the new
 * geometry.
 *
 * Note: if you wish to transform a geometry by a non-rigid transformation, 
 * you will need to call RemoveFromCache.  Otherwise, all subsequent
 * Load calls will load the transformed geometry.  Here, the TransformGeometry
 * method of this class does this for you.
 *
 * Note: geometries are not shared, but rather cached-and-copied.  Appearances
 * on the other hand are by default shared. To make an object have its own
 * custom appearance, call SetUniqueAppearance().
