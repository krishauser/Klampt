 * problem and may add in path sending hooks.
 * @sa RealTimeIKPlanner
 * @sa RealTimeTreePlanner
 *
 * Setup: Given a world and a robotIndex (typically 0), assuming the robot
 * model is set to its current configuration ...
 *
 * @code
 * MyRealTimePlanner planner; (initialize subclass as necessary)
 * SingleRobotCSpace cspace(...); (initialize cspace as necessary)
 * //set planning problem
 * planner.SetSpace(&cspace);
 * //set current path -- just stationary
 * planner.SetConstantPath(planner.robot->q);
 * //set objective
 * IKObjective* objective = new IKObjective(robot);
 * objective->ikGoal = ... // setup initial IK objective
 * planner.Reset(objective);
 * planner.sendPathCallback = new MySendPathCallback;
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Online: The planner should be launched in a parallel thread to the
 * execution thread. The planning thread should maintain a global timer,
 * synchronized with the execution thread. 
 *
 * @code
 * while(true) {
 *   Real t = currentGlobalTime();
 *   if(objectiveChanged) {
 *     //set new objective if needed
 *     IKObjective* objective = new IKObjective(robot);
 *     objective->ikGoal = ... // setup IK objective
 *     planner.Reset(objective);
 *   }
 * 
 *   Real splitTime, planTime;
 *   bool changed = planner.PlanUpdate(t,splitTime,planTime);
 *   //planner.sendPathCallback will be called if the planner succeeded
 * 
 *   if(changed) {
 *     printf("Path was successfully updated, split time %g, plan time %g\n",splitTime,planTime);
 *   }
 *   else {
 *     printf("Path update was unsuccessful, split time %g, plan time %g\n",splitTime,planTime);
